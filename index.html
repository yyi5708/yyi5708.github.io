<h1>Muhammad Yousaf Iqbal GitHub.io Page</h1>
<p>My name is Muhammad Yousaf Iqbal and I attended Sidney High School in Sidney, NY. My hobbies are that I like to play soccer, basketball, and football. I like to play video games and like watching videos about cars and technology. I was born in Lahore, Pakistan and moved to the U.S. when I was 4 years old. I don't regret this decision my parents made for us and our future as a whole.</p>
